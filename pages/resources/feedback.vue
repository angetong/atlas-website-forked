    <v-alert text type="info">
    Google Groups generally defaults to your personal email. If you would rather access this forum using your corporate email (as opposed to your gmail), you can create a Google account using your corporate email before joining the group.
    Also most email clients route emails from Google Groups into "Other"/"Spam"/"Forums" folder. So, you may want to create a rule in your email client to have these emails go into your inbox instead.
