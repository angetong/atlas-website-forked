  name: MITRE - Physical Adversarial Attack on Face Identification
  summary: >
    MITRE's AI Red Team demonstrated a physical-domain evasion attack on a
    commercial face identification service with the intention of inducing a
    targeted misclassification. This operation had a combination of traditional
    ATT&CK enterprise techniques such as finding Valid account, and Executing
    code via an API - all interleaved with adversarial ML specific attacks.

  procedure:
    - tactic: TA0043
      technique: AML.T0000
      description: >+
        The team first performed reconnaissance to gather information about the
        target ML model.

    - tactic: TA0001
      technique: T1078
      description: |+
        The team gained access via a valid account.

    - tactic: AML.TA0000
      technique: AML.T0040
      description: |+
        The team accessed the inference API of the target model.

    - tactic: TA0007
      technique: AML.T0013
      description: >+
        The team identified the list of identities targeted by the model by
        querying the target model's inference API.

    - tactic: TA0042
      technique: AML.T0002.000
      description: |+
        The team acquired representative open source data.

    - tactic: AML.TA0001
      technique: AML.T0005
      description: |+
        The team developed a proxy model using the open source data.

    - tactic: AML.TA0001
      technique: AML.T0043.000
      description: >+
        Using the proxy model, the red team optimized a physical domain
        patch-based attack using expectation over transformation.

    - tactic: AML.TA0000
      technique: AML.T0041
      description: |+
        The team placed the physical countermeasure in the physical environment.

    - tactic: TA0040
      technique: AML.T0015
      description: >+
        The team successfully evaded the model using the physical countermeasure
        and causing targeted misclassifications.
