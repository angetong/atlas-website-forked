## Website
v3.1.0
<br>

This website update adds new functionality in the form of multiple matrices support. All matrices can be found in the clickable tab in the main navigation bar titled "Matrices". The sidebar contains each matrix name for the user to select and switch between the visualizations. Breadcrumbs have also been updated to have direct routes to each matrix.

In addition, the "Tactics" and "Techniques" pages now support multiple matrices by having each matrix listed in their sidebar menus. Each matrix in the sidebar is a dropdown menu that houses its own tactics and techniques for more organized perusal. The information tables for each page also now contain all objects from all matrices to faciliate keyword searching as an alternative to the sidebar menus.
