Researchers from Microsoft Research demonstrated that many deep learning models deployed in mobile apps are vulnerable to backdoor attacks via \"neural payload injection.\" They conducted an empirical study on real-world mobile deep learning apps collected from Google Play, and found 54 apps that were vulnerable to attack, including popular security and safety critical applications used for as cash recognition, parental control, face authentication, and financial services among others.\n", "techniques": [{"techniqueID": "T1593", "showSubtechniques": true, "tactic": "reconnaissance"}, {"techniqueID": "T1593.002", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "reconnaissance"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0044", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "ml-model-access"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0017", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "resource-development"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0018", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "persistence"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0042", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "ml-attack-staging"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0010", "showSubtechniques": true, "tactic": "initial-access"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0010.003", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "initial-access"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0043", "showSubtechniques": true, "tactic": "ml-attack-staging"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0043.004", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "ml-attack-staging"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0041", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "ml-model-access"}, {"techniqueID": "AML.T0015", "color": "#C8E6C9", "tactic": "impact"}], "legendItems": [{"label": "ATLAS technique", "color": "#C8E6C9"}]}
