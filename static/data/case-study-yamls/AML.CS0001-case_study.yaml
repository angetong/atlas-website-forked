  name: Botnet Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) Detection Evasion
  summary: >
    The Palo Alto Networks Security AI research team was able to bypass a
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based botnet Domain Generation Algorithm
    (DGA) detection [1] by domain name mutations. It is a generic domain
    mutation technique which can evade most ML-based DGA detection modules. The
    generic mutation technique can also be used to test the effectiveness and
    robustness of all DGA detection methods developed by security companies in
    the industry before it is deployed to the production environment.

        DGA detection is a widely used technique to detect botnets in academia
        and industry.

        The searched for research papers related to DGA detection.

      technique: AML.T0002
      description: >+
        The researchers acquired a publicly available CNN-based DGA detection
        model [1] and tested against a well-known DGA generated domain name data
        sets, which includes ~50 million domain names from 64 botnet DGA
        families.

        The CNN-based DGA detection model shows more than 70% detection accuracy
        on 16 (~25%) botnet DGA families.

      technique: AML.T0017
      description: >+
        The researchers developed a generic mutation technique that requires a
        minimal number of iterations.

    - tactic: AML.TA0001
      technique: AML.T0043.001
      description: >+
        The researchers used the mutation technique to generate evasive domain
        names.

    - tactic: AML.TA0001
      technique: AML.T0042
      description: >+
        Experiment results show that, after only one string is inserted once to
        the DGA generated domain names, the detection rate of all 16 botnet DGA
        families can drop to less than 25% detection accuracy.

    - tactic: TA0005
      technique: AML.T0015
      description: >+
        The DGA generated domain names mutated with this technique successfully
        evade the target DGA Detection model, allowing an adversary to continue
        communication with their [Command and Control]() servers.
