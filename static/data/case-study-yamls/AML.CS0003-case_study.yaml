  name: Bypassing Cylance's AI Malware Detection
  summary: >
    Researchers at Skylight were able to create a universal bypass string that
    when appended to a malicious file evades detection by Cylance's AI Malware
    detector.

  procedure:
    - tactic: TA0043
      technique: T1594
      description: >+
        The researchers read publicly available information about Cylance's AI
        Malware detector.

    - tactic: AML.TA0000
      technique: AML.T0047
      description: >+
        The researchers used Cylance's AI Malware detector and enabled verbose
        logging to understand the inner workings of the ML model, particularly
        around reputation scoring.

    - tactic: TA0042
      technique: AML.T0017
      description: >+
        The researchers used the reputation scoring information to reverse
        engineer which attributes provided what level of positive or negative
        reputation.

        Along the way, they discovered a secondary model which was an override
        for the first model.

        Positive assessments from the second model overrode the decision of the
        core ML model.

      technique: AML.T0043.003
      description: >+
        Using this knowledge, the researchers fused attributes of known good
        files with malware to manually create adversarial malware.

    - tactic: TA0005
      technique: AML.T0015
      description: >+
        Due to the secondary model overriding the primary, the researchers were
        effectively able to bypass the ML model.
